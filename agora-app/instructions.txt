INSTRUCTIONS FOR TEAMMEMBERS:

RUNNING THE PROJECT:
cd into 'front-end', then type: npm start

Dependencies to download to run the project:
npm install react-scripts
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-dom
npm install express

For the backend packages cd into back-end and run:
npm install @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env nodemon --save-dev

This makes it so we can run the latest version of javascript (ES6) with Node which
runs on ES5 for some reason (I think)
