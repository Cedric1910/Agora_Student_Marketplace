INSTRUCTIONS FOR TEAMMEMBERS:

RUNNING THE PROJECT:
Front-End:
cd into 'front-end', then type: npm start

Back-End:
npm start in the root ('agora-app') or cd into 'back-end' then run

Dependencies to download to run the project:
npm install react-scripts
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-dom
npm install express
cd 'front-end' npm install axios
npm install redux
npm install redux-thunk

MOST OF THESE MAY BE INSTALLED SIMPLY BY DOING: npm install dependencies

npm install @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env nodemon --save-dev
- (This makes it so we can run the latest version of javascript (ES6) with Node which
runs on ES5)
