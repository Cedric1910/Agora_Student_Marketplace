    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Agora is a web service platform solely for students/graduates to buy, sell and trade second-hand items. 
      We find that current trading services are exploited due to poor mechanics and restrictions - more specifically,
      it is spammed with retail businesses that post repetitive listings.
      
      This is where they have lost the meaning of being a "second-hand" trading service, and instead a platform for retail businesses to market themselves.
      Agora aims to bring back the value of trading by targeting an audience that needs it the most - students.
      They can only create an account by using their University ID, which filters out all the unecessary retailers that we don't want. 
      This is the core differentiating factor Agora seeks to provide to customers, with a strict focus on delivering the best user experience..</p>
