In the project directory (INFO301/agora_student_marketplace/agora-app), you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the back-end server of the project, in the form of the file server.js
The server accepts requests on port 5000.

To run the front-end of the project, open a seperate terminal, navigate
to INFO/301/agora_student_marketplace/agora-app/front-end and run:
### `npm start`

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in the browser.


The page will reload if you make edits and save in the front-end folder.
The page won't reload if you make edits and save in the back-end folder, but the
backend server will restart, during this time data won't be served, so the pages
will more than likely have no actual content on them, just the standard markup.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
